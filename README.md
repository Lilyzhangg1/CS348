# WaterlooEats (CS348 Project)

WaterlooEats is a database-driven web application designed to help users in the Kitchener-Waterloo area discover, rate, and track local restaurants. This project uses FastAPI for the backend, React for the frontend, and SQLite as the database.

## Sample test
- located in the sample directory

## Fetching sample data
To fetch sample (and ultimately production) data, use the `fetch_clean_data.py` script, specify the range (radius) of the restaurant search to increase the number of tuples fetched.
## Fetching production data!
To fetch the production data we have migrated from `fetch_clean_data.py` script to the `fetch_grid.py` script that repeatedly makes places api calls at different co-ordinates, along the bounding box of kitchener waterloo. the bounding box was formed using [this site](http://bboxfinder.com/#43.396964,-80.596848,43.498617,-80.422440), calling the file with the radius parameter set, essentially sets how many calls you want to make (smaller radius, more calls, more accurate)

To get the api key, hit up Bk (ðŸ˜­ please don't query too much, money money)

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- SQLite
- Node.js

### Setup (Backend)

1. **Clone the repo**:

   cd waterlooeats
   ```
2. **Create and activate a virtual environment**:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/Scripts/activate  # On Mac/Linux: source venv/bin/activate
    ```
3. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
#### Sample (Do this to setup the sample database)
4. **Create sample database**:
   ```bash
   cd sample
   sqlite3 waterlooeats.db < ../db/tables_up.sql
   ```
5. **Insert sample data**:
    ```bash
    python3 insert_sample.py
    ```
#### Production (Do this to setup the production database)
6. **Create production database**:
    ```bash
    cd production
    sqlite3 waterlooeats.db < ../db/tables_up.sql
    ```
7. **Insert production restaurant data**
   ```bash
   python3 insert_production.py
   ```
8. **Run backend server**:
   make sure you're at the top level directory (above backend)
   ```bash
    uvicorn backend.main:app --reload
    ```
9.  **Run frontend server**:
   In a new terminal, run:
    ```bash
    cd frontend
